# Leo FFB V3



## Where did this come from?

Leo Bodnar (leobodnar.com) support emailed the Example.cpp file to me, at my request (Dec-Jan '25/26), without restriction on use or sharing. 

I have uploaded it here as-is for posterity and the improvement of force feedback implementations in older isiMotor sim racing video games and for the value of the physics maths for any video games that make use of FFB wheels.

## Version 3? Not the commonly available version 2?

Yes, it is "version 3". From what I've heard, source, for the commonly available Leo FFB 2.0 plugin, was lost at some point. Bodar support confirmed they couldn't find anything else related to Leo FFB. This version, besides missing a header file, does look like complete plugin source, however.
